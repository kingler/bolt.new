# Chat Components

This directory contains components for the chat interface in the application. These components define the structure and behavior of various elements within the chat interface, enabling a rich and interactive user experience.

## Structure

- `Artifact.tsx`: Component for displaying artifacts related to chat messages
- `AssistantMessage.tsx`: Component for rendering messages from the assistant
- `BaseChat.tsx`: Base component for the chat interface
- `Chat.client.tsx`: Main chat component that integrates various sub-components
- `CodeBlock.tsx`: Component for rendering code blocks with syntax highlighting
- `Markdown.tsx`: Component for rendering markdown content
- `Messages.client.tsx`: Component for displaying a list of chat messages
- `SendButton.client.tsx`: Component for the send button in the chat interface
- `UserMessage.tsx`: Component for rendering messages from the user

## Key Responsibilities

1. Defining the structure and behavior of chat interface components
2. Ensuring smooth animations and transitions within the chat interface
3. Providing syntax highlighting for code blocks
4. Rendering markdown content within chat messages
5. Managing the state and interactions of chat messages

## Development Guidelines

- Use memoization (React.memo) for performance optimization
- Utilize Framer Motion for animations and transitions
- Implement syntax highlighting using Shiki
- Render markdown content using React Markdown
- Use type hints and docstrings for better code readability

## Component Implementation

### Artifact.tsx

This component is responsible for displaying artifacts related to chat messages. It uses Framer Motion for animations and integrates with the workbench store to manage the state of artifacts.

### AssistantMessage.tsx

This component renders messages from the assistant. It uses the Markdown component to render the content as HTML.

### BaseChat.tsx

This is the base component for the chat interface. It provides the foundational structure and behavior for the chat interface, including handling user input and managing the state of chat messages.

### Chat.client.tsx

This is the main chat component that integrates various sub-components such as `BaseChat`, `ToastContainer`, and `ChatImpl`. It manages the overall state and interactions within the chat interface.

### CodeBlock.tsx

This component is responsible for rendering code blocks with syntax highlighting. It uses Shiki for syntax highlighting and provides a copy-to-clipboard feature.

### Markdown.tsx

This component renders markdown content within chat messages. It uses React Markdown and integrates with various plugins for enhanced markdown rendering.

### Messages.client.tsx

This component displays a list of chat messages. It differentiates between user messages and assistant messages and applies appropriate styling and animations.

### SendButton.client.tsx

This component represents the send button in the chat interface. It uses Framer Motion for animations and handles the click event to send messages.

### UserMessage.tsx

This component renders messages from the user. It sanitizes the user message content and uses the Markdown component to render the content.
