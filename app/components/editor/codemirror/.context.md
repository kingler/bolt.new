# CodeMirror Components

This directory contains components for integrating the CodeMirror editor into the application. These components define the structure and behavior of various elements within the CodeMirror editor, enabling a rich and interactive code editing experience.

## Structure

- `BinaryContent.tsx`: Component for displaying a message when a file format cannot be displayed
- `CodeMirrorEditor.tsx`: Main component for the CodeMirror editor integration
- `indent.ts`: Contains functions and key bindings for handling indentation in the editor
- `languages.ts`: Defines supported languages and their configurations for the editor
- `cm-theme.ts`: Defines themes and theme configurations for the editor

## Key Responsibilities

1. Defining the structure and behavior of CodeMirror editor components
2. Ensuring smooth and efficient code editing features
3. Providing syntax highlighting and language support
4. Managing themes and appearance of the editor
5. Handling indentation and other editor commands

## Development Guidelines

- Use memoization (React.memo) for performance optimization
- Utilize CodeMirror for code editing features and extensions
- Implement syntax highlighting and language support using CodeMirror's language packages
- Define and manage themes using CodeMirror's theming capabilities
- Use type hints and docstrings for better code readability

## Component Implementation

### BinaryContent.tsx

This component is responsible for displaying a message when a file format cannot be displayed. It provides a user-friendly message indicating that the file format is not supported for display.

### CodeMirrorEditor.tsx

This is the main component for integrating the CodeMirror editor into the application. It manages the overall state and interactions within the editor, including handling user input, applying themes, and configuring language support.

### indent.ts

This file contains functions and key bindings for handling indentation in the editor. It defines custom indentation logic and key bindings for the Tab and Shift+Tab keys to increase and decrease indentation levels.

### languages.ts

This file defines the supported languages and their configurations for the editor. It uses CodeMirror's language packages to provide syntax highlighting and language-specific features for various programming languages.

### cm-theme.ts

This file defines themes and theme configurations for the editor. It provides functions to get and reconfigure themes based on user preferences, and it uses CodeMirror's theming capabilities to apply custom styles to the editor.
