### indent.ts

This file contains functions and key bindings for handling indentation in the editor. It defines custom indentation logic and key bindings for the Tab and Shift+Tab keys to increase and decrease indentation levels.

#### Purpose
The purpose of this file is to provide custom indentation logic and key bindings for the CodeMirror editor, enhancing the user experience by allowing easy adjustment of indentation levels using the keyboard.

#### How It Works
1. **Imports and Dependencies**: The file imports necessary modules from CodeMirror, including commands and state management utilities.
   - **CodeMirror Imports**: These include `indentLess` from `@codemirror/commands`, `indentUnit` from `@codemirror/language`, and various types and classes from `@codemirror/state` and `@codemirror/view`.

2. **Key Binding Definition**: A key binding object `indentKeyBinding` is defined to handle the Tab and Shift+Tab keys.
   - **Tab Key**: The `Tab` key is bound to the `indentMore` function, which increases the indentation level.
   - **Shift+Tab Key**: The `Shift+Tab` key is bound to the `indentLess` function, which decreases the indentation level.

3. **Indentation Logic**: The `indentMore` function is defined to handle increasing the indentation level.
   - **Read-Only Check**: The function first checks if the editor is in read-only mode. If it is, the function returns `false` and no action is taken.
   - **Dispatch Update**: If the editor is not read-only, the function dispatches an update to the editor state, applying the indentation change.
   - **Change by Selected Line**: The `changeBySelectedLine` function is called to apply the indentation change to the selected lines or the current cursor position.

4. **Change by Selected Line**: The `changeBySelectedLine` function is defined to handle changes to the editor state based on the selected lines.
   - **Single Line Selection**: If a single line is selected, the function applies the indentation change to that line.
   - **Multiple Characters in a Single Line**: If multiple characters are selected within a single line, the function applies the indentation change to the selected range.
   - **Multiple Lines Selection**: If the selection spans multiple lines, the function iterates through each line and applies the indentation change.

5. **State Changes**: The function creates a set of changes and applies them to the editor state.
   - **Change Set**: A change set is created based on the changes array.
   - **Range Update**: The selection range is updated to reflect the new positions after the changes are applied.

By following these steps, the `indent.ts` file provides a robust and flexible way to handle indentation in the CodeMirror editor, allowing users to easily adjust indentation levels using the keyboard.

### languages.ts

This file defines the supported languages and their configurations for the editor. It uses CodeMirror's language packages to provide syntax highlighting and language-specific features for various programming languages.

#### Purpose
The purpose of this file is to configure and provide support for various programming languages within the CodeMirror editor. This enables the editor to offer syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and other language-specific features, enhancing the coding experience for users.

#### How It Works
1. **Imports and Dependencies**: The file imports the `LanguageDescription` class from the `@codemirror/language` package.
   - **CodeMirror Imports**: These include necessary modules to define and load language configurations dynamically.

2. **Supported Languages Definition**: An array `supportedLanguages` is defined, containing `LanguageDescription` objects for each supported language.
   - **LanguageDescription Objects**: Each object specifies the language name, file extensions, and an asynchronous `load` function to import the corresponding CodeMirror language package.
   - **Example**: For TypeScript (TS), the `load` function imports the `@codemirror/lang-javascript` module and configures it with TypeScript support.

3. **Dynamic Language Loading**: The `getLanguage` function is defined to dynamically load the appropriate language configuration based on the file name.
   - **Filename Matching**: The function uses `LanguageDescription.matchFilename` to find a matching language description from the `supportedLanguages` array.
   - **Asynchronous Loading**: If a matching language is found, the function asynchronously loads and returns the language configuration. If no match is found, it returns `undefined`.

4. **Language Configuration**: Each language configuration includes syntax highlighting and other language-specific features provided by CodeMirror.
   - **Syntax Highlighting**: The loaded language packages provide syntax highlighting rules for the respective languages.
   - **Language-Specific Features**: Additional features such as autocompletion, bracket matching, and indentation rules are also included in the language configurations.

By following these steps, the `languages.ts` file ensures that the CodeMirror editor can support a wide range of programming languages, providing a rich and customizable coding environment for users.
