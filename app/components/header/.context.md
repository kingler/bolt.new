# Header Components

This directory contains components for the header interface in the application. These components define the structure and behavior of various elements within the header, enabling a rich and interactive user experience.

## Structure

- `Header.tsx`: Main component for the header interface
- `HeaderActionButtons.client.tsx`: Component for action buttons within the header

## Key Responsibilities

1. Defining the structure and behavior of header components
2. Ensuring smooth and efficient user interactions
3. Managing state and interactions within the header
4. Providing action buttons for user interactions

## Development Guidelines

- Use memoization (React.memo) for performance optimization
- Utilize Nano Stores for state management
- Implement client-side rendering using Remix Utils
- Use type hints and docstrings for better code readability

## Component Implementation

### Header.tsx

This is the main component for the header interface. It manages the overall state and interactions within the header, including displaying the logo, chat description, and action buttons.

### HeaderActionButtons.client.tsx

This component is responsible for rendering action buttons within the header. It manages the state of the chat and workbench visibility, providing buttons to toggle these states.
