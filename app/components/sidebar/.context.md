# Sidebar Components

This directory contains components for the sidebar interface in the application. These components define the structure and behavior of various elements within the sidebar, enabling a rich and interactive user experience.

## Structure

- `HistoryItem.tsx`: Component for displaying individual chat history items
- `Menu.client.tsx`: Main component for the sidebar menu
- `date-binning.ts`: Utility functions for binning chat history items by date

## Key Responsibilities

1. Defining the structure and behavior of sidebar components
2. Ensuring smooth animations and transitions within the sidebar
3. Managing state and interactions of chat history items
4. Providing utility functions for date manipulation and binning

## Development Guidelines

- Use memoization (React.memo) for performance optimization
- Utilize Framer Motion for animations and transitions
- Implement dialog components using Radix UI
- Use Date-fns for date manipulation and formatting
- Use type hints and docstrings for better code readability

## Component Implementation

### HistoryItem.tsx

This component is responsible for displaying individual chat history items. It handles hover interactions and provides a delete button for removing chat history items. The component uses Radix UI for the delete confirmation dialog.

### Menu.client.tsx

This is the main component for the sidebar menu. It manages the overall state and interactions within the sidebar, including loading chat history items, handling mouse events for opening and closing the menu, and displaying the list of chat history items.

### date-binning.ts

This file contains utility functions for binning chat history items by date. It uses Date-fns for date manipulation and provides functions to categorize chat history items into bins such as "Today", "Yesterday", "This Week", "Last 30 Days", and specific months and years.
