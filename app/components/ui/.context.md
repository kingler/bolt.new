# UI Components

This directory contains reusable UI components for the application. These components define the structure and behavior of various elements within the user interface, enabling a rich and interactive user experience.

## Structure

- `IconButton.tsx`: Component for rendering an icon button with various sizes and states
- `LoadingDots.tsx`: Component for displaying animated loading dots
- `PanelHeader.tsx`: Component for rendering a header for panels
- `PanelHeaderButton.tsx`: Component for rendering a button within a panel header
- `Slider.tsx`: Component for rendering a slider with selectable options
- `ThemeSwitch.tsx`: Component for toggling between light and dark themes
- `Dialog.tsx`: Component for rendering dialogs with various states and animations

## Key Responsibilities

1. Defining the structure and behavior of UI components
2. Ensuring smooth animations and transitions within the UI
3. Providing reusable and customizable UI elements
4. Managing state and interactions of UI components

## Development Guidelines

- Use memoization (React.memo) for performance optimization
- Utilize Framer Motion for animations and transitions
- Implement dialog components using Radix UI
- Use type hints and docstrings for better code readability

## Component Implementation

### IconButton.tsx

This component is responsible for rendering an icon button with various sizes and states. It supports different icon sizes, custom class names, and disabled states. The component uses memoization for performance optimization.

### LoadingDots.tsx

This component displays animated loading dots. It uses a state to manage the number of dots and an effect to update the dots at a regular interval. The component is memoized for performance optimization.

### PanelHeader.tsx

This component renders a header for panels. It accepts custom class names and children elements. The component uses memoization for performance optimization.

### PanelHeaderButton.tsx

This component renders a button within a panel header. It supports custom class names, disabled states, and click events. The component uses memoization for performance optimization.

### Slider.tsx

This component renders a slider with selectable options. It supports custom options and manages the selected state. The component uses Framer Motion for animations and memoization for performance optimization.

### ThemeSwitch.tsx

This component toggles between light and dark themes. It uses a store to manage the theme state and an effect to ensure the component is only rendered after the DOM is loaded. The component uses memoization for performance optimization.

### Dialog.tsx

This component renders dialogs with various states and animations. It uses Radix UI for dialog functionality and Framer Motion for animations. The component supports custom class names, children elements, and click events for closing the dialog.
