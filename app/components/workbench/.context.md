# Workbench Components

This directory contains components for the workbench interface in the application. These components define the structure and behavior of various elements within the workbench interface, enabling a rich and interactive user experience.

## Structure

- `EditorPanel.tsx`: Component for the main editor panel within the workbench
- `FileBreadcrumb.tsx`: Component for displaying the breadcrumb navigation of files
- `FileTree.tsx`: Component for displaying the file tree structure
- `PortDropdown.tsx`: Component for selecting and displaying available ports
- `Preview.tsx`: Component for rendering the preview of the code
- `Workbench.client.tsx`: Main workbench component that integrates various sub-components

## Key Responsibilities

1. Defining the structure and behavior of workbench interface components
2. Ensuring smooth animations and transitions within the workbench interface
3. Providing a navigable file tree and breadcrumb structure
4. Managing the state and interactions of the editor and preview panels
5. Handling port selection and display within the workbench

## Development Guidelines

- Use memoization (React.memo) for performance optimization
- Utilize Framer Motion for animations and transitions
- Implement dropdown menus using Radix UI
- Use React Resizable Panels for creating resizable panel layouts
- Use type hints and docstrings for better code readability

## Component Implementation

### EditorPanel.tsx

This component is responsible for the main editor panel within the workbench. It integrates the CodeMirror editor and manages the state of the editor, including handling file selection, saving, and resetting. It also includes a terminal panel that can be toggled and resized.

### FileBreadcrumb.tsx

This component displays the breadcrumb navigation of files. It uses Radix UI for the dropdown menu and Framer Motion for animations. It allows users to navigate through the file structure easily.

### FileTree.tsx

This component is responsible for displaying the file tree structure. It provides a hierarchical view of the files and folders, allowing users to select and navigate through the file system.

### PortDropdown.tsx

This component handles the selection and display of available ports. It provides a dropdown menu for users to select a port and displays the currently active port.

### Preview.tsx

This component renders the preview of the code. It is integrated within the workbench to provide a live preview of the code being edited.

### Workbench.client.tsx

This is the main workbench component that integrates various sub-components such as `EditorPanel`, `FileBreadcrumb`, `FileTree`, `PortDropdown`, and `Preview`. It manages the overall state and interactions within the workbench interface.
