# Terminal Components

This directory contains components for the terminal interface in the workbench. These components define the structure and behavior of the terminal, enabling a rich and interactive user experience within the workbench.

## Structure

- `Terminal.tsx`: Main component for the terminal interface
- `theme.ts`: Utility functions for managing terminal themes

## Key Responsibilities

1. Defining the structure and behavior of terminal components
2. Ensuring smooth and efficient terminal interactions
3. Managing state and interactions within the terminal
4. Providing theme customization for the terminal

## Development Guidelines

- Use memoization (React.memo) for performance optimization
- Utilize XTerm.js for terminal emulation
- Implement terminal resizing using ResizeObserver
- Use type hints and docstrings for better code readability

## Component Implementation

### Terminal.tsx

This is the main component for the terminal interface. It integrates XTerm.js for terminal emulation and manages the state of the terminal, including handling terminal resizing, theme customization, and terminal interactions. It also includes add-ons for fitting the terminal to its container and handling web links.

### theme.ts

This file contains utility functions for managing terminal themes. It provides functions to retrieve CSS variables and apply them to the terminal theme, allowing for customization of terminal colors and styles.
