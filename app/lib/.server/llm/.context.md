# LLM Components

This directory contains components and utilities for handling interactions with language models. These components provide essential functionalities such as API key management, model configuration, and streaming text processing, enabling efficient and secure communication with language models.

## Structure

- `api-key.ts`: Utility functions for managing API keys
- `constants.ts`: Constants used across the LLM components
- `model.ts`: Functions for configuring and retrieving language models
- `prompts.ts`: Utility functions for handling prompts
- `stream-text.ts`: Functions for streaming text processing
- `switchable-stream.ts`: Class for handling switchable streams

## Key Responsibilities

1. Managing API keys for secure access to language models
2. Configuring and retrieving language models
3. Handling streaming text processing
4. Providing constants for consistent configuration
5. Managing switchable streams for dynamic data handling

## Development Guidelines

- Use memoization for performance optimization
- Utilize Web Streams API for handling streaming data
- Implement network requests using Fetch API
- Use type hints and docstrings for better code readability

## Component Implementation

### api-key.ts

This file contains utility functions for managing API keys. It provides a function to retrieve the API key from the environment variables, ensuring secure access to the language models.

#### Purpose
The purpose of this file is to securely manage API keys, ensuring that the application can access language models without exposing sensitive information.

#### How It Works
1. **getAPIKey**: This function retrieves the API key from the environment variables. It checks both the Node.js environment and the Cloudflare environment to ensure compatibility across different deployment scenarios.

### constants.ts

This file contains constants used across the LLM components. It defines the maximum number of tokens and the maximum number of response segments that can be returned in a single request.

#### Purpose
The purpose of this file is to provide consistent configuration values for the LLM components, ensuring that the application adheres to the limitations and guidelines of the language models.

#### How It Works
1. **MAX_TOKENS**: This constant defines the maximum number of tokens that can be processed in a single request.
2. **MAX_RESPONSE_SEGMENTS**: This constant defines the maximum number of response segments that can be returned in a single request.

### model.ts

This file contains functions for configuring and retrieving language models. It provides a function to create and configure an instance of the Anthropic language model.

#### Purpose
The purpose of this file is to configure and retrieve language models, enabling the application to interact with the language models in a consistent and efficient manner.

#### How It Works
1. **getAnthropicModel**: This function creates and configures an instance of the Anthropic language model using the provided API key. It returns a configured instance of the language model that can be used for processing text.

### prompts.ts

This file contains utility functions for handling prompts. It provides functions to manage and format prompts for the language models.

#### Purpose
The purpose of this file is to manage and format prompts, ensuring that the application can interact with the language models in a structured and efficient manner.

#### How It Works
1. **getSystemPrompt**: This function retrieves and formats the system prompt, ensuring that the language model receives a consistent and structured prompt for processing.

### stream-text.ts

This file contains functions for streaming text processing. It provides a function to stream text to and from the language models, enabling real-time interaction with the language models.

#### Purpose
The purpose of this file is to handle streaming text processing, enabling the application to interact with the language models in real-time.

#### How It Works
1. **streamText**: This function streams text to and from the language models. It retrieves the API key and model configuration, sets up the streaming options, and processes the text in real-time.

### switchable-stream.ts

This file contains a class for handling switchable streams. It provides a class that extends the TransformStream class, enabling dynamic switching of data sources.

#### Purpose
The purpose of this file is to manage switchable streams, allowing the application to dynamically switch data sources during streaming.

#### How It Works
1. **SwitchableStream**: This class extends the TransformStream class and provides methods to switch data sources dynamically. It manages the state of the current reader and controller, ensuring smooth and efficient data handling during streaming.
