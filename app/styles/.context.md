# Styles

This directory contains styles and variables for the application. These styles define the visual appearance and layout of various elements within the application, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing user experience.

## Structure

- `animations.scss`: Contains animations and keyframes
- `index.scss`: Main stylesheet that imports other style files
- `variables.scss`: Defines CSS variables for themes and elements
- `z-index.scss`: Manages z-index values for different components

## Key Responsibilities

1. Defining the visual appearance and layout of application elements
2. Ensuring consistency and maintainability of styles
3. Providing theme customization through CSS variables
4. Managing z-index values for proper layering of components

## Development Guidelines

- Use SCSS for modular and maintainable styles
- Define CSS variables for theme customization
- Follow BEM methodology for class naming
- Ensure proper layering of components using z-index values

## Module Implementation

### animations.scss

This file contains animations and keyframes used throughout the application. It defines various animation classes and keyframes to provide smooth transitions and effects.

**Purpose:**
The purpose of this file is to define animations and keyframes that can be reused across the application to enhance the user experience with smooth transitions and effects.

**How it works:**
1. Defines animation classes such as `.animated`, `.fadeInRight`, and `.fadeOutRight`.
2. Specifies keyframes for animations like `fadeInRight` and `fadeOutRight`.
3. Provides a `.dropdown-animation` class with a `fadeMoveDown` keyframe for dropdown animations.

### index.scss

This is the main stylesheet that imports other style files. It ensures that all styles are included and applied consistently across the application.

**Purpose:**
The purpose of this file is to serve as the main entry point for styles, importing other style files to ensure consistency and maintainability.

**How it works:**
1. Imports various style files such as `variables.scss`, `z-index.scss`, `animations.scss`, and component-specific styles.
2. Defines global styles for `html` and `body` elements to ensure full height and width.

### variables.scss

This file defines CSS variables for themes and elements. It provides a centralized location for managing theme colors, element styles, and other design tokens.

**Purpose:**
The purpose of this file is to define CSS variables that can be used throughout the application for theme customization and consistent styling of elements.

**How it works:**
1. Defines CSS variables for light and dark themes using `:root` and `[data-theme='light']`, `[data-theme='dark']` selectors.
2. Specifies variables for colors, backgrounds, text, buttons, items, loaders, artifacts, actions, messages, icons, dividers, prompts, sidebars, previews, terminals, and CTAs.
3. Provides terminal-specific color variables for both light and dark themes.

### z-index.scss

This file manages z-index values for different components. It ensures proper layering and stacking order of elements within the application.

**Purpose:**
The purpose of this file is to define z-index values for various components to ensure proper layering and stacking order.

**How it works:**
1. Defines a maximum z-index value `$zIndexMax` and assigns z-index values to different components such as `.z-logo`, `.z-sidebar`, `.z-port-dropdown`, `.z-iframe-overlay`, `.z-prompt`, `.z-workbench`, and `.z-file-tree-breadcrumb`.
2. Provides a `.z-max` class with the maximum z-index value for elements that need to be on top.

## Usage Example

To use these styles in your components, import the necessary SCSS files and apply the defined classes and variables. For example, to use an animation, add the corresponding class to your element:
