# Type Definitions

This directory contains type definitions for various components and modules in the application. These type definitions ensure type safety and code clarity, enabling a robust and maintainable codebase.

## Structure

- `actions.ts`: Defines types for actions within the application
- `artifact.ts`: Defines types for artifacts within the application
- `terminal.ts`: Defines types for terminal interactions
- `theme.ts`: Defines types for theme settings

## Key Responsibilities

1. Providing type definitions for various components and modules
2. Ensuring type safety and code clarity
3. Facilitating maintainable and robust codebase

## Development Guidelines

- Use TypeScript interfaces and types for type safety
- Ensure clear and concise type definitions
- Use descriptive names for types and interfaces

## Type Definitions Implementation

### actions.ts

This file defines types for actions within the application. It includes types for different action types such as file actions and shell actions.

**Purpose:**
The purpose of this file is to define types for actions within the application, ensuring type safety and clarity when handling different actions.

**How it works:**
1. Defines the `ActionType` type, which can be either 'file' or 'shell'.
2. Defines the `BaseAction` interface with a `content` property.
3. Defines the `FileAction` interface, extending `BaseAction` and adding a `filePath` property.
4. Defines the `ShellAction` interface, extending `BaseAction`.
5. Defines the `BoltAction` type, which can be either `FileAction` or `ShellAction`.
6. Defines the `BoltActionData` type, which can be either `BoltAction` or `BaseAction`.

### artifact.ts

This file defines types for artifacts within the application. It includes types for artifact data.

**Purpose:**
The purpose of this file is to define types for artifacts within the application, ensuring type safety and clarity when handling artifact data.

**How it works:**
1. Defines the `BoltArtifactData` interface with `id` and `title` properties.

### terminal.ts

This file defines types for terminal interactions. It includes types for terminal properties and methods.

**Purpose:**
The purpose of this file is to define types for terminal interactions within the application, ensuring type safety and clarity when handling terminal operations.

**How it works:**
1. Defines the `ITerminal` interface with optional `cols` and `rows` properties.
2. Defines methods for the `ITerminal` interface, including `reset`, `write`, and `onData`.

### theme.ts

This file defines types for theme settings. It includes types for different themes.

**Purpose:**
The purpose of this file is to define types for theme settings within the application, ensuring type safety and clarity when handling theme configurations.

**How it works:**
1. Defines the `Theme` type, which can be either 'dark' or 'light'.

## Usage Example

To use these types in your components, import the necessary type definitions and apply them to your variables, functions, and components. For example, to define a function that accepts a `BoltActionData` parameter:
