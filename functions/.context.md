# Server-Side Functions

This directory contains server-side functions for handling requests and responses in the application. These functions define the logic for processing incoming requests, interacting with the server build, and generating appropriate responses.

## Structure

- `[[path]].ts`: Main server-side function for handling requests

## Key Responsibilities

1. Handling incoming requests and generating appropriate responses
2. Interacting with the server build generated by Remix
3. Ensuring proper error handling and logging

## Development Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for type safety and better code readability
- Follow Remix conventions for server-side code
- Implement proper error handling and logging mechanisms

## Function Implementation

### [[path]].ts

This file contains the main server-side function for handling requests. It uses the `createPagesFunctionHandler` from `@remix-run/cloudflare-pages` to create a handler for Cloudflare Pages.

#### Purpose

The purpose of this function is to handle incoming requests, interact with the server build generated by Remix, and generate appropriate responses.

#### How It Works

1. **Import Statements**: The file starts with importing necessary types and functions from `@remix-run/cloudflare` and `@remix-run/cloudflare-pages`.
   ```typescript
   import type { ServerBuild } from '@remix-run/cloudflare';
   import { createPagesFunctionHandler } from '@remix-run/cloudflare-pages';
   ```

2. **Server Build Import**: The server build file generated by `remix vite:build` is imported. The `@ts-ignore` comment is used to ignore TypeScript errors for this import.
   ```typescript
   // @ts-ignore because the server build file is generated by `remix vite:build`
   import * as serverBuild from '../build/server';
   ```

3. **Request Handler**: The `createPagesFunctionHandler` function is used to create a request handler. The `serverBuild` is cast to `ServerBuild` type and passed to the handler.
   ```typescript
   export const onRequest = createPagesFunctionHandler({
     build: serverBuild as unknown as ServerBuild,
   });
   ```

This function ensures that incoming requests are processed using the server build generated by Remix, and appropriate responses are generated based on the request and server logic.
