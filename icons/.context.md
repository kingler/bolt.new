# Icons

This directory contains SVG icons used throughout the application. These icons are designed to be scalable and lightweight, providing a consistent visual language across the user interface.

## Structure

- `chat.svg`: Icon representing a chat or messaging feature
- `logo-text.svg`: Icon containing the text version of the application's logo
- `logo.svg`: Icon containing the graphical version of the application's logo
- `stars.svg`: Icon representing stars, often used for ratings or highlights

## Key Responsibilities

1. Providing scalable vector graphics for various UI elements
2. Ensuring consistent styling and dimensions across all icons
3. Optimizing SVG files for performance

## Development Guidelines

- Use SVG format for all icons to ensure scalability and performance
- Optimize SVG files to reduce file size and improve loading times
- Maintain consistent styling, such as stroke width and color, across all icons
- Ensure all icons are accessible and have appropriate `aria` labels if necessary

## Icon Descriptions

### chat.svg

This icon represents a chat or messaging feature. It is used in various parts of the application where user interaction or messaging is involved.

**Purpose**: To visually indicate chat or messaging functionality.

**How it works**: 
- The SVG defines a chat bubble with a stroke and rounded corners.
- The `stroke` attribute is set to `currentColor`, allowing the icon to inherit the color of its parent element.
- The `stroke-linecap` and `stroke-linejoin` attributes ensure smooth and rounded edges.

### logo-text.svg

This icon contains the text version of the application's logo. It is used in branding and marketing materials where the text representation of the logo is required.

**Purpose**: To provide a text-based representation of the application's logo.

**How it works**: 
- The SVG defines the text elements and paths that make up the logo.
- The `viewBox` attribute ensures the logo scales correctly within its container.
- The `fill` attribute is used to set the color of the text and shapes.

### logo.svg

This icon contains the graphical version of the application's logo. It is used in various parts of the application, such as the header or footer, to represent the brand visually.

**Purpose**: To provide a graphical representation of the application's logo.

**How it works**: 
- The SVG defines a rectangle with rounded corners and a path that represents the logo's design.
- The `fill` attribute is used to set the colors of the rectangle and the logo path.
- The `viewBox` attribute ensures the logo scales correctly within its container.

### stars.svg

This icon represents stars, often used for ratings or highlights. It is used in parts of the application where user ratings or featured content are displayed.

**Purpose**: To visually indicate ratings or highlight important content.

**How it works**: 
- The SVG defines multiple star shapes using path elements.
- The `fill` attribute is set to `currentColor`, allowing the stars to inherit the color of their parent element.
- The `viewBox` attribute ensures the stars scale correctly within their container.

## Usage Example

To use these icons in your application, you can include the SVG files directly in your HTML or import them as React components if you are using a React-based framework.
